# Customer Churn Prediction

Predicting customer churn using machine learning can help businesses identify which customers are likely to leave, enabling proactive retention strategies.

## Overview

Customer churn refers to the situation where a customer stops using a companyâ€™s product or service. In this project, I developed a machine learning solution to predict customer churn. The goal was to help businesses reduce revenue loss and improve customer satisfaction through early intervention.

Using Python and popular machine learning libraries, I trained and evaluated several models to find the most effective approach for churn prediction.

## Model Performance

I trained multiple machine learning models and evaluated their performance using accuracy as the metric. Below are the results:

* **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** 0.90
* **Logistic Regression:** 0.89
* **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** 0.89
* **Decision Tree Classifier:** 0.885
* **Random Forest Classifier:** 0.84

Among all the models, the SVM achieved the highest accuracy. However, each model has its strengths depending on the specific needs, such as interpretability, training time, or scalability.
